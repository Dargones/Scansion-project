    1: Di coniugales tuque genialis tori,
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^^^X_^^^X_^X|X^^^_X_^^^X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^^^X_^X
Reason: 'i' in coniugales is a consonant, but the program fails to determine
this, because there is no data on coniugalis in the dictionary. Making
the program to look at related words such as coniunx should solve the problem
(right now the program only considers inflections of the same lemma).

    2: Lucina, custos quaeque domituram freta
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^_^^_^X|X_^_X_^^^X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^^^X_^X
Reason: Not enough data on "domituram" in the dictionary. Similarly, making
the program look at related words such as "domitus" should help.
Also, the lemmatizer does not recognize this as a possible form of "domo".

    3: Peperi. Querelas uerbaque in cassum sero?
Program failed to determine the meter.
Correct scansion: ^^_^_X_^_X_^X
Reason: The problem is with "sero". The "e" must be short here, but the
dictionary has only instances of "sero" with long "e". There are a lot of
instances of "sero" in the dictionary and so the program does not even use the
lemmatizer in this case (I probably should because then it would know, for
instance, about "serit" with short "e").

    4: Per uiscera ipsa quaere supplicio uiam,
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^_X^^^X|X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Reason: Final 'o' is dative/ablative should be long. Probably, I should hardcode
this. Exceptions to this rule will then be the lines that the program fails to
scan

    5: Repudia thalamis: quo uirum linques modo?
Multiple answers. Program output:X^^^^^X_^_X_^X|^^_^^^X_^_X_^X
Correct scansion: X^^^^^X_^_X_^X
Reason: The problem is with determining that "i" in repudia is short. In theory,
"i" is almost always short in this position, but I believe that there are some
exceptions so I did not hardcode this.

    6: tamen uidendum est. tota patefient mala.
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^_^^_^X|X_^_X_^^^X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^^^X_^X
Reason: The dictionary has no data on "patefio". Although there are entries on
forms of "patefacio" that can also be the forms of "patefio", the lemmatizer
does not connect the two verbs.

    7: Mittarue praeceps saxa per Scironia?
Incorrect answer. Program output:X^^^_X_^_X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^_X_^X
Reason: "u" in "mittarue" is considered to be a vowel. Either the lemmatizer
does not know that this is a form from mitto, or I don't treat "-ue" properly.

    8: Vultur relicto transuolet Tityo ferus
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^_X^^^X|X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Reason: Final 'o' is dative/ablative should be long. Probably, I should hardcode
this. Exceptions to this rule will then be the lines that the program fails to
scan

    9: Huc, huc, reliquias uehite cari corporis
Incorrect answer. Program output:^^_^^^X_^_X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^^^X^^^_X_^X
Reason: Not sure why the program thinks that "huc" can be short. Should fix this

    10: Solusue fierem, facinus ausurus parens
Multiple answers. Program output:X^^^^^X^^^_X_^X|^^_^^^X^^^_X_^X|^^^^^_X^^^_X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^^^X^^^_X_^X
Reason: Same problem with "-ue" as in case 8. This seems to be something I
should focus on.

    11: Durate trepidae lugubri officio manus,
Program failed to determine the meter.
Correct scansion: X_^^^X_^_^^_^X
Reason: "u" in lugubri is short, though always long in the dictionary. While
this is not strictly a problem, I make the program fail in these cases so that
the differences in language can be seen.

    12: Grauisque tellus impio capiti incubet.
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^_^^_^X|X_^_X_^^^X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Reason: Final 'o' is dative/ablative should be long. Probably, I should hardcode
this. Exceptions to this rule will then be the lines that the program fails to
scan

    13: Nero insitiuus, Domitio genitus patre,
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^^^^^_^X|X_^_X^^^_^^_^X|X_^_X^^^^^X_^X|X^^^_X_^_^^_^X|X^^^_X_^^^X_^X|^^_^_X_^_^^_^X|^^_^_X_^^^X_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X^^^_^^_^X
Reason: Very weird case with "ins"! Fix this! first "i" in domitio is short, but
the word is not in the dictionary. Similar to case 2.

    14: Natumque ad umbras, prodidit lapsam domum.
Program failed to determine the meter.
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^_X_^X
Reason: Here, muta cum liquida closes the syllable. I am not sure why this error
occurs, but this is something that should be easy to fix.

    15: Manes parentis neue sollicita tuae,
Multiple answers. Program output:X_^_X_^_X^^^X|X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Correct scansion: X_^_X_^_^^_^X
Reason: "sollicita" is imperative, hence, 'a' is long. The program has no means
of determining this

    16: Dubia labat ceruice? famuli, attollite,
Multiple answers. Program output:X^^^_X_^^^X_^X|^^_^_X_^^^X_^X
Correct scansion: ^^_^_X_^^^X_^X
Reason: "Dubia" agrees with "cervice", hence it is ablative, hence "a" is long.
This is something the program cannot determine.

    17: Veneremur aras.  Cecidit ante aras pater.
Multiple answers. Program output:X^^^_X^^^_X_^X|^^_^_X^^^_X_^X
Correct scansion: ^^_^_X^^^_X_^X
Reason: Because "veneremur" is subjunctive, the second "e" must be long, but the
program cannot determine that and so prints multiple options

    18: Iouem precemur pariter.  Herceum Iouem?
Program failed to determine the meter.
Correct scansion: X_^__^^^_X_^X
Reason: "Herceum" is not in the dictionary and, by default, "eu" is considered
to be a diphthong by my program which is obviously an oversimplification
(I may be wrong on this issue. I don't know whether it is more usual for
"eu" to stand for one long syllable or for two shorts.).
